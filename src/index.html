                            Aman Bansal works as a software engineer in the tech industry. He enjoys
                            building softwares and is continuously exploring various aspects of
                            computer science, especially Artificial Intelligence. He hates doing
                            repetitive tasks and is constantly finding ways to automatize them. But
                            he is not a complete dweeb who is always glued to the computer. Music is
                            something that he is extremely passionate about but it quite finicky
                            about the kind of music he likes to hear or SING. Yes, he also sings and
                            in fact, can play various instrument as well. Lately, he has also
                            started working out as well (courtesy of COVID-19 pandemic).
